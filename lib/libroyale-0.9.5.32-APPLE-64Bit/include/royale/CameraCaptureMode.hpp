     *  The CameraCaptureMode defines the low-level parameters for setting up an operation mode
     *  for the ToF camera. Besides framerate. This functionality is only exposed through the
     *  access LEVEL 3 and not available for LEVEL 1/2.
     *  Since not all sequences are supported by the framework, the setCaptureMode() validates
     *  the specified mode and asks the camera module and processing if the mode is supported.
     *
     *  Example:
     *    - The simple capture mode takes four raw frames and delivers one depth image with 45 fps. This is specified
     *      by `CameraCaptureMode(CaptureOutputType::Depth, 45, { { 30000000, 1000 } });`. This specifies a
     *      modulation frequency of 30 Mhz and an exposure value of 1 ms. The data output will be depth information
     *      which can be retrieved by setting a listener for the ICameraDevice.
